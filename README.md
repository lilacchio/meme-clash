# MEMECLASH 🐸⚔️
> **The First Permissionless Creator-Owned Prediction Market on Solana.**

## 🚨 The Problem
Prediction markets today are **boring** and **gatekept**.
- **Centralized**: Only the platform decides what you can bet on.
- **Sterile**: They look like spreadsheets for accountants.
- **Extractive**: Users provide all the liquidity and volume, but the platform keeps 100% of the fees.

## ⚡ The Solution: MemeClash
**MemeClash** is a permissionless, high-energy prediction market built for the **Meme Economy**. We turn gamblers into hosts.

### Key Features

- **🎨 Permissionless Chaos UI**: A Neo-Brutalist design system that embraces the raw energy of crypto twitter.
- **📈 CPMM Logic**: Automated Market Maker ensuring infinite liquidity for every bet.
